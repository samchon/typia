/**
 * Verifies schema-directed coercion for anyof nullable null.
 *
 * This case checks that a stringified null chooses the null alternative rather
 * than constructing an object. Authored schema input isolates utility semantics
 * from compiler production.
 *
 * 1. Supply the explicit schema and original malformed or repeatedly encoded
 *    input.
 * 2. Call LlmJson directly and compare every retained result distinction.
 *
 * @evidence contracts/testing.md#behavioral-verification Direct LlmJson.parse/coerce calls check that a stringified null chooses the null alternative rather than constructing an object.
 * @evidence contracts/testing.md#independent-expectations Literal schema kinds are authored from the declared fixture shape, not produced by typia. Authored values and explicit scalar, field or complete-array expectations establish the result independently of the conversion implementation; these assertions do not certify unasserted properties.
 * @evidence contracts/testing.md#distinguishing-cases The distinguishing contribution is that a stringified null chooses the null alternative rather than constructing an object. Complementary string/no-string, nullable/non-null and affirmative/negative cases run in the same direct population. This case does not establish malformed-input rejection, reference-cycle handling or the correctness of compiler-produced schemas.
 * @evidence contracts/testing.md#execution-ownership test-utils test:unit registers this exported case with node:test under a plugin-free configuration and oracle. No native producer, installed consumer or host is needed for these assertions; transformer-to-utility assembly remains a separate boundary responsibility.
