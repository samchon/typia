/**
 * Resolved type that erases every method.
 *
 * `Resolved` is a TMP (Type Meta Programming) type which converts
 * its argument as a resolved type that erases every method property.
 *
 * If the target argument is a built-in class which returns its origin primitive type
 * through the `valueOf()` method like the `String` or `Number`, its return type would
 * be the `string` or `number`. Otherwise, the built-in class does not have the
 * `valueOf()` method, the return type would be same with the target argument.
 *
 * Otherwise, if the target argument is a type of custom class, all of its custom methods
 * would be erased and its prototype would be changed to the primitive `object`.
 * Therefore, the return type of the TMP type would finally be the resolved object.
 *
 * Before                  | After
 * ------------------------|----------------------------------------
 * `Boolean`               | `boolean`
 * `Number`                | `number`
 * `BigInt`                | `bigint`
 * `String`                | `string`
 * `Class`                 | `interface`
 * Native Class or Others  | No change
