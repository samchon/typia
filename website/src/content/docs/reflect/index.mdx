# Reflection

Typia provides powerful **compile-time type reflection** capabilities that allow you to analyze TypeScript types at runtime. Through the reflection system, you can extract detailed structural information about your types, including their properties, validation constraints, nested structures, and more.

The reflection system is the foundation that powers many of typia's advanced features like runtime validation, JSON schema generation, and LLM function calling.

## Overview

Typia's reflection system works by analyzing TypeScript types during the compilation phase and generating rich metadata structures that can be used at runtime. This allows you to:

- **Introspect Types**: Understand the structure and constraints of your types
- **Generate Schemas**: Create JSON schemas, validation logic, and documentation
- **Runtime Analysis**: Analyze type information that would normally be lost at runtime
- **Tool Integration**: Build tools and libraries that work with type information

## Key Concepts

### Compile-Time Analysis
Unlike traditional reflection systems that work at runtime, typia analyzes types during TypeScript compilation. This means:
- Zero runtime overhead for type analysis
- Full access to TypeScript's type system
- Preservation of generic type information
- Support for complex type constructs

### Metadata Structure
The reflection system generates structured metadata that describes:
- **Atomic types**: `string`, `number`, `boolean`, etc.
- **Complex types**: Objects, arrays, tuples, unions
- **Validation constraints**: Type tags, comments, and decorators
- **Relationships**: How types relate to each other
- **Nullability**: Optional and nullable properties

### Transformation Pipeline
The reflection process involves:
1. **Type Analysis**: TypeScript AST parsing and type checking
2. **Metadata Generation**: Converting types to structured metadata
3. **Optimization**: Removing redundant information and optimizing structure
4. **Serialization**: Converting to JSON-serializable format

## Use Cases

### API Documentation
Generate comprehensive API documentation directly from TypeScript types:

```typescript
// Your API types
interface UserCreateRequest {
  name: string;
  email: string;
  age?: number;
}

// Extract metadata for documentation
const metadata = typia.reflect.metadata<[UserCreateRequest]>();
// Use metadata to generate OpenAPI specs, docs, etc.
```

### Schema Generation
Create validation schemas from your types:

```typescript
interface Product {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  price: number & tags.Minimum<0>;
  tags?: string[];
}

const metadata = typia.reflect.metadata<[Product]>();
// Use metadata to generate JSON Schema, validation logic, etc.
```

### Tool Development
Build development tools that understand your types:

```typescript
// Analyze a complex type structure
const metadata = typia.reflect.metadata<[ComplexType]>();

// Walk through the metadata to:
// - Generate test data
// - Create mock objects  
// - Build type-safe utilities
// - Perform static analysis
```

## Getting Started

To start using typia's reflection capabilities, make sure you have typia properly configured in your TypeScript project. The reflection system requires compile-time transformation, so ensure your build pipeline includes typia's transformer.
