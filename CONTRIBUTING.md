# Contribution Guide

## Before Opening An Issue

Search the existing tracker first:

- [Issues](https://github.com/samchon/typia/issues)

When reporting a bug, include:

- the `typia` version
- the TypeScript version
- a minimal reproduction
- expected behavior and actual behavior

When proposing an improvement, include:

- the problem you are trying to solve
- the proposed solution
- examples of the expected behavior

## Repository Shape

`typia` is a pnpm monorepo. The main directories are:

```text
typia/
├── packages/              # Publishable packages and internal package sources
│   ├── typia/             # User-facing package and CLI
│   ├── interface/         # Shared public typings
│   ├── utils/             # Runtime/OpenAPI/LLM utilities
│   ├── langchain/         # LangChain integration
│   ├── mcp/               # MCP integration
│   └── vercel/            # Vercel AI SDK integration
├── tests/                 # Test workspaces and generated test fixtures
│   ├── template/          # Shared test structures package (@typia/template)
│   └── test-*/            # Test suites
├── examples/              # Example source used by docs and playground flows
├── benchmark/             # Benchmark generators and result archives
├── website/               # Documentation site and playground app
├── experiments/           # Local tarball and experiment flows
├── scripts/               # Repository utility scripts
└── config/                # Shared build configuration
```

## Current Paths

There are two important build/setup paths in the repository:

1. Stable current path: `typia` with package-declared `ttsc.plugin`, `ttsc`, and `typescript`
2. Dedicated runner path: `ttsx` from the `ttsc` project for direct TypeScript execution

## Build And Test

Root scripts:

```bash
pnpm run build
pnpm run test
pnpm run package:tgz
```

Important caveats:

- `pnpm run build` builds `packages/*`
- `pnpm run test` runs the `start` script of `tests/test-*`
- some package-local strongest paths are **not** covered by the root `test`
- `tests/template` is a workspace package used by automated suites
- `website` has its own install/build pipeline and consumes local tarballs from `experiments/tarballs`

Recommended contributor workflow:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run build
pnpm run test
```

If you touch one of these areas, run its local path too:

- `website`: `cd website && npm install && npm run build`
- tarball-dependent flows: `pnpm run package:tgz`

## Working In Packages

Start from the package closest to the behavior you are changing:

- public API and CLI: `packages/typia`
- runtime/shared typing surfaces: `packages/interface`, `packages/utils`
- adapter integrations: `packages/langchain`, `packages/mcp`, `packages/vercel`
- ttsc host or runner behavior: the sibling `../ttsc` repository

## Documentation And Strategy

Documentation lives in multiple layers:

- root `README.md`: public product overview
- `website/`: end-user docs and playground

If you update one layer and it changes the public contract, check the others too.

## Pull Requests

Before opening a PR:

- make sure the relevant package/test/docs flow still works
- mention any path that is intentionally not covered by your local verification
- call out changes to support boundaries, release policy, or experimental behavior explicitly
